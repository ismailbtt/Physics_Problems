## 4. Rearranging Formulas

The formula for the period of a simple pendulum is $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$. Rearrange the equation give a formula for $g$ (acceleration due to gravity).

To rearrange the formula for the period of a simple pendulum to solve for $g$, follow these algebraic steps:

1. **Start with the original formula:**

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$


2. **Divide both sides by $2\pi$ to isolate the square root:**

$$\frac{T}{2\pi} = \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$


3. **Square both sides of the equation to remove the square root:**

$$\left(\frac{T}{2\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{L}{g}$$


$$\frac{T^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{L}{g}$$


4. **Multiply both sides by $g$ and then by $\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}$ to isolate $g$ (or simply take the reciprocal of both sides and multiply by $L$):**

$$g \cdot \frac{T^2}{4\pi^2} = L$$


$$g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$$



**Final Formula:**


$$g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$$
